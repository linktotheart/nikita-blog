    "title": "Hi! I'm Nikita",
    "description": "I am a 21-year-old Mass Communication student and an upcoming media professional. I graduated with the batch 2020 during a global pandemic, which makes it interesting already! In my free time, I doodle and make DIY art. Sometimes I dab hands at cooking. I recently started blogging my dishes on Instagram @nikkirheablog. I love teaching kids and I usually involve myself in NGOs for child support. I currently volunteer at Nachiket Balgram an orphanage in Pune. With a perpetual hunger for knowledge in cinema, I am a social media enthusiast with a head for marketing. Having watched Mad Men, I wanted to be the Don Draper of the world, but the quick realization DON-ed upon me that the AD world is more than just whiskeys and charms. Itâ€™s an entourage of people who survive on creativity. And so, I hope to find a place in this Mad world.",
