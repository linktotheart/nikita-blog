    "description": "I am a 21-year-old Mass Communication student and an upcoming media professional. I graduated with the batch 2020 during a global pandemic, which makes it interesting already!\n\nI enjoy approaching complex projects with a holistic approach. A large part of my success while working with people stems from my ability to cultivate an intuitive understanding of their needs, and spearhead the project from there. Have a look at the work I’ve done in the past, and get in touch to learn more.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n> ## **Content** *Strategy* Writing\n>\n> ## *Campaign Management*\n>\n> ## Branding ***Social Media***\n>\n> ## Events *Content* Fundraising *Creative Initiatives*\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
    "about": "In my free time, I doodle and make DIY art. Sometimes I dab hands at cooking. I recently started blogging my dishes on Instagram @nikkirheablog. I love teaching kids and I usually involve myself in NGOs for child support. I currently volunteer at Nachiket Balgram an orphanage in Pune. With a perpetual hunger for knowledge in cinema, I am a social media enthusiast with a head for marketing. Having watched Mad Men, I wanted to be the Don Draper of the world, but the quick realization DON-ed upon me that the AD world is more than just whiskeys and charms. It’s an entourage of people who survive on creativity. And so, I hope to find a place in this Mad world."
