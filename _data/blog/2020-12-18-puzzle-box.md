For a class assignment, I was asked to make a Board Game and its packaging.

The topic for the game was **Right and Wrong Readings in Printing technology.**

I designed the board game concept and creative and the packaging of the box.

The aim of the assignment was to get an experience of the printing process from idea generation, Pre-press, Press, Post-press and will be able to calculate costs for the deliverables.
