SparkAR is a program that allows us to create our own filters on Instagram and Facebook. And with its super intuitive interface, I created an effect that was specific to the brand Artisan Raw. A UK -based vegan cheese company I was interning for.

The filter has a quiz-style interactive interface wherein the user can click and record to interact with the brands products in a fun way.

The brand **Artisan Raw** is a vegan upmarket food brand. They specialise in healthy artisanal vegan cheese and desserts. They required their audience to interact more with their offerings in order to increase awareness and lead to a sale. AR filters are a fun and interesting way of branding. When I knew that there's a face segmentation that allows certain movements to activate the fun quiz mode, I played around with the idea of revealing a “which cheese is your pick ?”

This showcases subtle branding and logo, their entire product range and slogan.

The interaction that triggers the effect is when the user presses the record button, finally revealing a random pick. Which I think is an intuitive move and mimics the mechanical feeling of taking something apart.
